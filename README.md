## 1. Python for AI

Python is the most widely used language in AI and Machine Learning.  
This section covers:

- Python syntax and variables
- Control structures (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- File handling
- Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP)

📂 Folder: `/python_basics`  
📄 Sample files: `variables.py`, `loops.py`, `functions.py`

## 2. NumPy Basics

NumPy is the foundation for numerical operations in Python.

What you'll find in this section:

- Creating and manipulating arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Array slicing and indexing
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting
- Random number generation
- Practical examples for AI data handling

📂 Folder: `/numpy_basics`  
📄 Sample files: `arrays.py`, `matrix_operations.py`, `random_data.py`

## 🚀 Coming Soon

- Pandas for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib for visualization  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Neural networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- Real AI projects and mini-apps  

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

> More dependencies will be listed as modules are added.
