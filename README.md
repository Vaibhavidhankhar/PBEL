# 🧠 AI Learning Repository

Welcome to my AI learning journey!  
This repository contains code, notes, and examples related to Artificial Intelligence, starting with **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.  

This repository documents my progress through the foundational concepts and tools in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. It's structured in modules, starting from the basics of Python to building simple predictive models.
More modules like **Scikit-learn**, and **Deep Learning** will be added soon.

## 1️⃣ Python Basics

> 📍 Folder: `1_Python_Basics/`

### 🔍 Description:
Python is the backbone of modern AI development. This module introduces the fundamentals of Python, even if you come from a C/C++ background.

### 🧩 Topics Covered:
- Variables, data types, operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Functions and recursion
- File handling
- Error handling (try-except)
- Classes & Objects (OOP fundamentals)

📂 Folder: `/python_basics`  
📄 Sample files: `variables.py`, `loops.py`, `functions.py`

## 3️⃣ Pandas – Data Analysis

📍 Folder: 3_Pandas/
🔍 Description:
Pandas makes working with structured data easy and efficient. From importing datasets to complex data manipulations, this module covers it all.

### 🧩 Topics Covered:
- Series vs DataFrames
- Reading/writing CSV and Excel files
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
- Filtering, sorting, merging, and grouping
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 4️⃣ Data Visualization

📍 Folder: 4_Visualization/
🔍 Description:
Visualization is key to understanding data. This module introduces tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to help create meaningful and aesthetic plots.

### 🧩 Topics Covered:
- Line charts, bar charts, pie charts
- Histograms and box plots
- Heatmaps and pair plots
- Customization: colors, titles, labels, legends
- Plotting distributions and correlations

---

## 5️⃣ Linear Regression – First ML Model

📍 Folder: 5_Linear_Regression/
🔍 Description:
This module introduces supervised learning with Linear Regression using scikit-learn. You'll build your first predictive model and learn how to evaluate it.

### 🧩 Topics Covered:
- Understanding the linear equation (y = mx + c)
- Preparing data for training
- Fitting a linear regression model
- Predicting and evaluating results
- Metrics: MSE, RMSE, R² Score
- Visualizing regression lines
